This is Scripts for a very basic tic tac toe game I made using unity.

My Focus for the project was familiarizing myself with unity.

As the prject was quite simple, the scripts are also very basic, and are just meant
to work while not necesarily being the most efficient scripts.

It is also worth mentioning that this was my first time working with C# and unity.
